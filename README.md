# CarrierBillingCheckOut

Sandbox API Repository to describe, develop, document, and test the CarrierBillingCheckOut Service API(s). The repository does not yet belong to a CAMARA Sub Project.

* API Repository [wiki page](https://lf-camaraproject.atlassian.net/wiki/x/CDDe)

## Scope
* Service APIs for “CarrierBillingCheckOut” (see APIBacklog.md)  
* It provides the API consumer with the ability to: 
  * Trigger carrier billing payment request (in one or two steps), which is a process that allows API consumers to make purchases by charging payments against Telco Operator Billing Systems.
    * Follow up of payment, by means of query endpoints to get information about a list of payments or a specific payment.
  * Trigger carrier billing refund request, which is a process that allows API consumers to ask for a `total` or `partial` return of the amount associated to a previous performed payment.
    * Follow up of refund, by means of query endpoints to get information about a list of refunds or a specific refund.
  * NOTE: The scope of these APIs should be limited (at least at a first stage) to 4G and 5G.
* Describe, develop, document and test the APIs (with 1-2 Telcos)  
* Started: October 2022
