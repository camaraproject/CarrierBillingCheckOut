    Service Enabling Payments against Operator Carrier Billing Systems

    # Introduction

    The Carrier Billing API provides programmable interface for developers and other users (capabilities consumers) to charge an amount on a mobile line.
    It can be easily integrated and allows end-users to buy digital content in an easy & secured way. The API provides management of a payment entity and its associated lifecycle.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    - **Carrier Billing**:
    An online payment process which allows users to make purchases by charging payments against Telco Operator Billing Systems, accordingly to the user's configuration in the Telco Operator. In a common usage in the industry, the payment is processed on current account balance or charged on next bill generated for this line.

    - **Payment**:
    The process of paying for a (set of) good(s)/service(s).

    - **1-STEP Payment**:
    Payment process performed in one phase (i.e. one action), that involves all the Telco Operator Carrier Billing Systems checking and trigger the charging request against Billing Systems.

    - **2-STEP Payment**:
    Payment process performed in two phases (i.e. two actions). First action deals with payment preparation request to guarantee the reservation of the involved amount. Second action is an explicit confirmation or cancellation of the payment by the user. Any payment not confirmed/cancelled by a given user is discarded after some time in order to avoid inconsistency in the billing systems.

    # API Functionality

    This API allows to third party clients to request the payment of a (set of) digital good(s)/service(s), as well as to retrieve information about a specific payment or a list of payments.

    In the scope of **version v0.3, only one-off payments are covered**. Recurrent payments (a.k.a. payment subscriptions) are not covered so far.

    The API provides several endpoints/operations:
    - An endpoint to request a 1-STEP Payment, named `createPayment`.
    - A set of endpoints to request a 2-STEP Payment:
      - One endpoint to setup the payment reservation, named `preparePayment`.
      - A couple of endpoints to confirm/cancel such payment reservation, named `confirmPayment` and `cancelPayment` respectively.
    - A set of endpoints to retrieve information about a list of payments or a specific payment (identified by its specific `paymentId`), named `retrievePayments` and `retrievePayment` respectively.
    - A callback endpoint where API Server can send notifications about a payment procedure, as defined within `createPayment` and `preparePayment` operations, towards the `sink` when provided by API client.

    The usage of the API is based on Payment resource, which can be created (in 1-STEP or 2-STEP Payment process), confirmed/cancelled (for 2-STEP Payment process), and queried/retrieved (list of payments or a specific payment).

    Before starting to use the API, the developer needs to know about the below specified details:
    - **Payment service endpoint**: The URL pointing to the RESTful resource of the payment API. As 1-STEP and 2-STEP processes are managed, 2 separate tags _`One Step Payment`_ and _`Two Step Payment`_ have been defined to explicitly distinguish them in the API specification. A third tag _`Payment`_ is defined for common operations in both processes (query/retrieve list of payments or a specific payment).
    - **1-STEP & 2-STEP Payment**:
      - **1-STEP Payment**: The request intent is to charge an amount to the mobile line. When the server receives the request, it will check the user account associated with this line and, if nothing prevents it, the amount is charged and will be either bill in next invoice or removed from current line credit/balance.
      - **2-STEP Payment**: The first call is to request a payment preparation, which implies an amount reservation. The amount is not charged and the server has to be ready to get a confirmation or a cancellation to perform the payment. Only when the confirmation is done, payment is charged. Depending on business rules of the Telco operator, a `prepared` payment could expire after a defined delay.
    - **Notification URL**: Developers may provide a callback URL (`sink` param) on which status change notifications, regarding the payment, can be received from the Telco Operator. This is an optional parameter.

    Follow picture provides information about the payment state engine (state description & transition):
    ![Payment State Engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/main/documentation/API_documentation/resources/Carrier_Billing_State_Engine.JPG)

    State transitions:

    **1-STEP Payment**

    If `createPayment` is a **SYNC** process:
    - Response contains `paymentId` and paymentStatus=`succeeded`.
    - In case of any error scenario `paymentId` is not created.

    If `createPayment` is an **ASYNC** process:
    - Response contains `paymentId` and paymentStatus=`processing`. After completion:
      - When payment is successfully completed then paymentStatus=`succeeded`.
      - When payment is not successfully performed then paymentStatus=`denied`.
    - In case of any error scenario `paymentId` is not created.

    **2-STEP Payment**

    FIRST STEP

    If `preparePayment` is a **SYNC** process:
    - **Case A** - `validationInfo` is NOT provided in response.
      - Response contains `paymentId` and paymentStatus=`reserved`.
    - **Case B** - `validationInfo` is provided in response.
      - Response contains `paymentId` and paymentStatus=`pending_validation`.
    - In case of any error scenario `paymentId` is not created.

    If `preparePayment` is an **ASYNC** process:
    - **Case A** - `validationInfo` is NOT provided in response.
      - Response contains `paymentId` and paymentStatus=`processing`. After completion:
        - When payment preparation is successfully completed then paymentStatus=`reserved`.
        - When payment preparation is not successfully performed then paymentStatus=`denied`.
    - **Case B** - `validationInfo` is provided in response.
      - Response contains `paymentId` and paymentStatus=`processing`. After completion:
        - When payment preparation is successfully completed then paymentStatus=`pending_validation`. [1]
        - When payment preparation is not successfully performed then paymentStatus=`denied`.
    - In case of any error scenario `paymentId` is not created.

    [OPTIONAL] VALIDATE STEP [1]

    After `validatePayment`, paymentStatus=`reserved` OR `denied`, depending whether it was successful or not.

    SECOND STEP

    After `confirmPayment`, paymentStatus=`succeeded` OR `denied`, depending whether it was successful or not.

    After `cancelPayment`, paymentStatus=`cancelled`.

    # Generic Clarification about optional parameters

    Regarding optional parameters, they can be conditionally mandatory for a Telco Operator to implement them based on business scenarios or applicable regulations in a given market.

    NOTE: Within a given market, in a multi Telco Operator ecosystem, the set of optional parameters to be implemented MUST be aligned among involved Telco Operators.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the provider of the application consuming the API and the operator's API exposure platform, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Identifying the phone number from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a phone number as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `phoneNumber` field, which therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `phoneNumber` field is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `phoneNumber` field is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same phone number is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

        Retrieve a list of payments and their details based on some filtering criteria.
        Regardless the payment criteria provided, response MUST be always limited to payments performed by the API client (i.e same oAuth credentials) triggering this request.
        This is to guarantee no API client can check payments performed by other, therefore avoiding any legal or privacy topic.

        When Access Token is issued for a given user phone number, the list of payments returned would be only the ones associated to that user phone number and API client. When Access Token is not associated to a user phone number, therefore only associated to API client the list of payments returned would be all the ones managed by that API client.

        Considerations regarding `paymentCreationDate.gte`, `paymentCreationDate.lte`:
        - If both included, return payments in that date range
        - If no one included, no filtering by date range is applied
        - If only settled `paymentCreationDate.gte`, `paymentCreationDate.lte` is considered current date-time
        - If only settled `paymentCreationDate.lte`, every payment existing in the Operator billing system until such date is returned
