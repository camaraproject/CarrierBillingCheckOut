    Service Enabling Refunds against Operator Carrier Billing Systems

    # Introduction

    The Carrier Billing Refund API provides programmable interface for developers and other users (capabilities consumers) to perform a refund over a given payment.
    The API provides management of a refund entity and its associated lifecycle.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    - **Carrier Billing**:
    An online payment process which allows users to make purchases by charging payments against Telco Operator Billing Systems, accordingly to the user's configuration in the Telco Operator. In a common usage in the industry, the payment is processed on current account balance or charged on next bill generated for this line.

    - **Payment**:
    The process of paying for a (set of) good(s)/service(s).

    - **Refund**:
    The process of returning the amount involved in a given payment (totally or partially) back to the user.

    # API Functionality

    This API allows to third party clients to request the refund of a given payment, as well as to retrieve information about a specific refund or a list of refunds.

    The API provides several endpoints/operations:
    - An endpoint to request a refund, named `createRefund`.
    - A set of endpoints to retrieve information about a list of refunds or a specific refund (identified by its specific `refundId`), named `retrieveRefunds` and `retrieveRefund` respectively.
    - A callback endpoint where API Server can send notifications about a refund procedure, as defined within `createRefund` operation, towards the `sink` when provided by API client.
    - An endpoint to retrieve remaining amount on a payment taken into consideration processed refund, named `retrievePaymentRemainingAmount`.

    State transitions:

    If `createRefund` is a **SYNC** process:
    - Response contains `refundId` and refundStatus=`succeeded`.
    - In case of any error scenario `refundId` is not created.

    If `createRefund` is an **ASYNC** process:
    - Response contains `refundId` and refundStatus=`processing`. After completion:
      - When refund is successfully completed then refundStatus=`succeeded`.
      - When refund is not successfully performed then refundStatus=`denied`.
    - In case of any error scenario `refundId` is not created. That means a `denied` Refund is not considerated as an error for the ASYNC process, because a `denied` Refund is a refund that has been created (i.e. the refund resource exists) and after applying the internal business logic has been settled to `denied` refundStatus.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details on how a client requests an access token. Please refer to Identify and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the Profile.

    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.

      summary: Get a list of refunds
      operationId: retrieveRefunds
      description: |-
        Retrieve a list of refunds and their details for a specific payment, identified by its `paymentId`, based on some filtering criteria.
        Regardless the refund criteria provided, response MUST be always limited to refunds performed by the API client (i.e same oAuth credentials) triggering this request.
        This is to guarantee no API client can check refunds performed by other, therefore avoiding any legal or privacy topic.

        When Access Token is issued for a given user phone number, the list of refunds returned would be only the ones associated to that user phone number and API client. When Access Token is not associated to a user phone number, therefore only associated to API client the list of refunds returned would be all the ones managed by that API client.

        Considerations regarding `refundCreationDate.gte`, `refundCreationDate.lte`:
        - If both included, return refunds in that date range
        - If no one included, no filtering by date range is applied
        - If only settled `refundCreationDate.gte`, `refundCreationDate.lte` is considered current date-time
        - If only settled `refundCreationDate.lte`, every refund existing in the Operator billing system until such date is returned

      summary: Get remaining amount not refunded for a given payment
      operationId: retrievePaymentRemainingAmount
      description: |-
        Retrieve remaining amount not yet refunded for a given payment. This amount refers to the pending amount never requested to be refunded (i.e. a refund not yet consolidated -processing- implies that such an amount is not part of the remaining amount until final status for that procedure is reached). Some cases below to illustrate the behaviour:

        **Case_1:** Payment of 80 EUR, with 2 partial `succedeed` Refunds, each of them of 20 EUR
          - remainingAmount: 40 EUR

        **Case_2:** Payment of 80 EUR, with 2 partial Refunds, one `succeeded` of 20 EUR and other `processing` of 15 EUR
          - remainingAmount: 45 EUR (API cannot return 60 EUR, because there is an ongoing refund process)

            ***SubCase_A***: Second partial Refund of 15 EUR is `succeeded`
              - remainingAmount: 45 EUR

            ***SubCase_B***: Second partial Refund of 15 EUR is `denied`
              - remainingAmount: 60 EUR

        **Case_3:** Payment of 80 EUR, with 1 total `succeeded` Refund
          - remainingAmount: 0 EUR

        **Case_4:** Payment of 80 EUR, with 1 total `processing` Refund
          - remainingAmount: 0 EUR (API cannot return 80 EUR, because there is an ongoing refund process)

            ***SubCase_A***: Total Refund is `succeeded`
              - remainingAmount: 0 EUR

            ***SubCase_B***: Total Refund is `denied`
              - remainingAmount: 80 EUR

        When Access Token is issued for a given user phone number, information would be returned in case the `paymentId` is associated to that user phone number and API client, otherwise `404 NOT_FOUND` will be returned. When Access Token is not associated to a user phone number, the information is returned in case the API client managed that payment.
