    Service Enabling Refunds against Operator Carrier Billing Systems

    # Introduction

    The Carrier Billing Refund API provides programmable interface for developers and other users (capabilities consumers) to perform a refund over a given payment.
    The API provides management of a refund entity and its associated lifecycle.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    - **Carrier Billing**:
    An online payment process which allows users to make purchases by charging payments against Telco Operator Billing Systems, accordingly to the user's configuration in the Telco Operator. In a common usage in the industry, the payment is processed on current account balance or charged on next bill generated for this line.

    - **Payment**:
    The process of paying for a (set of) good(s)/service(s).

    - **Refund**:
    The process of returning the amount involved in a given payment (totally or partially) back to the user.

    # API Functionality

    This API allows to third party clients to request the refund of a given payment, as well as to retrieve information about a specific refund or a list of refunds.

    The API provides several endpoints/operations:
    - An endpoint to request a refund, named `createRefund`.
    - A set of endpoints to retrieve information about a list of refunds or a specific refund (identified by its specific `refundId`), named `retrieveRefunds` and `retrieveRefund` respectively.
    - A callback endpoint where API Server can send notifications about a refund procedure, as defined within `createRefund` operation, towards the `sink` when provided by API client.
    - An endpoint to retrieve remaining amount on a payment taken into consideration processed refund, named `retrievePaymentRemainingAmount`.

    State transitions:

    If `createRefund` is a **SYNC** process:
    - Response contains `refundId` and refundStatus=`succeeded`.
    - In case of any error scenario `refundId` is not created.

    If `createRefund` is an **ASYNC** process:
    - Response contains `refundId` and refundStatus=`processing`. After completion:
      - When refund is successfully completed then refundStatus=`succeeded`.
      - When refund is not successfully performed then refundStatus=`denied`.
    - In case of any error scenario `refundId` is not created. That means a `denied` Refund is not considerated as an error for the ASYNC process, because a `denied` Refund is a refund that has been created (i.e. the refund resource exists) and after applying the internal business logic has been settled to `denied` refundStatus.

    # Generic Clarification about optional parameters

    Regarding optional parameters, they can be conditionally mandatory for a Telco Operator to implement them based on business scenarios or applicable regulations in a given market.

    NOTE: Within a given market, in a multi Telco Operator ecosystem, the set of optional parameters to be implemented MUST be aligned among involved Telco Operators.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

      description: |-
        Retrieve a list of refunds and their details for a specific payment, identified by its `paymentId`, based on some filtering criteria.
        Regardless the refund criteria provided, response MUST be always limited to refunds performed by the API client (i.e same oAuth credentials) triggering this request.
        This is to guarantee no API client can check refunds performed by other, therefore avoiding any legal or privacy topic.

        When Access Token is issued for a given user phone number, the list of refunds returned would be only the ones associated to that user phone number and API client. When Access Token is not associated to a user phone number, therefore only associated to API client the list of refunds returned would be all the ones managed by that API client.

        Considerations regarding `refundCreationDate.gte`, `refundCreationDate.lte`:
        - If both included, return refunds in that date range
        - If no one included, no filtering by date range is applied
        - If only settled `refundCreationDate.gte`, `refundCreationDate.lte` is considered current date-time
        - If only settled `refundCreationDate.lte`, every refund existing in the Operator billing system until such date is returned

      summary: Get remaining amount not refunded for a given payment
      operationId: retrievePaymentRemainingAmount
      description: |-
        Retrieve remaining amount not yet refunded for a given payment. This amount refers to the pending amount never requested to be refunded (i.e. a refund not yet consolidated -processing- implies that such an amount is not part of the remaining amount until final status for that procedure is reached). Some cases below to illustrate the behaviour:

        **Case_1:** Payment of 80 EUR, with 2 partial `succedeed` Refunds, each of them of 20 EUR
          - remainingAmount: 40 EUR

        **Case_2:** Payment of 80 EUR, with 2 partial Refunds, one `succeeded` of 20 EUR and other `processing` of 15 EUR
          - remainingAmount: 45 EUR (API cannot return 60 EUR, because there is an ongoing refund process)

            ***SubCase_A***: Second partial Refund of 15 EUR is `succeeded`
              - remainingAmount: 45 EUR

            ***SubCase_B***: Second partial Refund of 15 EUR is `denied`
              - remainingAmount: 60 EUR

        **Case_3:** Payment of 80 EUR, with 1 total `succeeded` Refund
          - remainingAmount: 0 EUR

        **Case_4:** Payment of 80 EUR, with 1 total `processing` Refund
          - remainingAmount: 0 EUR (API cannot return 80 EUR, because there is an ongoing refund process)

            ***SubCase_A***: Total Refund is `succeeded`
              - remainingAmount: 0 EUR

            ***SubCase_B***: Total Refund is `denied`
              - remainingAmount: 80 EUR

        When Access Token is issued for a given user phone number, information would be returned in case the `paymentId` is associated to that user phone number and API client, otherwise `404 NOT_FOUND` will be returned. When Access Token is not associated to a user phone number, the information is returned in case the API client managed that payment.
